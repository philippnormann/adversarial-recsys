\begin{abstract}
Today \acp{RS} are an established part of modern web-services and are deployed by numerous companies. Owing to the success of \acp{DNN} in other domains, the industry has started implementing \acp{RS} using \acp{DNN}. However, \acp{DNN} were shown to be vulnerable to targeted adversarial attacks in recent studies. While there have been several studies on the subject of adversarial attacks against \ac{CF} based \acp{RS} only few studies focusing on content-based \acp{RS} have been published. In this thesis, we showed that a visual content-based \acp{RS} using \acp{DNN} is vulnerable to targeted adversarial attacks using state-of-the-art white-box attacks. In the next step, we tested different defense mechanisms utilizing \ac{AT} and were able to show that \ac{AT} had a significant positive impact on the robustness of our trained models against our performed attacks.
